"""Build a small monochrome-bitmap test font from Terminus (TTF).

pyftsubset drops EBDT/EBLC, so the strike is pruned by hand and re-attached to
the subsetted font. The result is renamed because "Terminus" is an OFL Reserved
Font Name and this is a Modified Version.

Run next to TerminusTTF-Regular.ttf.
